-detect water from tif images
 -UNN (unet neural net) for detecting water bodies
     -Adam optimiser
     -Relu activation
     -512x512 input with 3 bands
     -resulting a model that creates masks with water bodies
     Network was trained using tensorflow-gpu, with requirements:
     -GPU min Nvidia 1050 2GB (the batch size should be reduced it, for a weaker gpu)
     -python 3.6.x
     -anaconda
     -Cuda
     -Nvidia Gpu Computing Toolkit
     -CuDNN
     -tensorlow
     -keras
     -tensorflow-gpu
-Java image processing:
-detect water bodies from .tif images
-class for creating maks for unet resulted from combining green wave_bands and NIF band .tif images, calculate NDIW(normalized  water index) NDWI per pixel = green - nif / green + nif , with  result >= 0.45 as water pixe;
-class for creating subimages of 512x512 for UNet from Nif and masks, with 3 band RGB (without alpha!!)
